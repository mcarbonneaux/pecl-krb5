  - run make && make install
  - optional: enable your new extension in you php.ini

+ When compiling statically into your php binary
  - move this extension into your php distributions ext/ folder
  - make sure that the directory is named "krb5"
  - run ./buildconf --force in the root directory of you php distribution
  - ./configure php with your common flags and add --with-krb5 and optionally
  	--with-krb5kadm=<path> where <path> is the path to your mit-krb5 
	distribution.

Warning:
+ This distribution now includes the missing headers from mit-krb5 (1.6),
   if you experience wierd problems you might want to use the headers from
   your own distribution (specifiy path to the krb5 source via 
   --with-krb5kadm=/path/to/krb5/source) as neither source nor binary compatability are guaranteed.
